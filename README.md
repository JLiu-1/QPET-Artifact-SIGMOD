# QPET-Artifact

This is the Artifact repository of SIGMOD '26 paper submission: **QPET: A Versatile and Portable Quantity-of-Interest-preservation Framework for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression**.

This **main** branch includes the overall readme and the evaluation results. Codes and evaluation instructions are in **other branches**.


## QPET-integrated Compression Codes and Evaluation
**Important:** Please check the other branches for artifact codes and evaluation instructions (the codes are frozen before the submission and revision deadline).
The **szfamily_** branches are for SZ3/HPEZ-QPET, and **sperr_** branches are for SPERR-QPET. The **qoi_hpez** branch is the baseline **QoI-HPEZ**.
## Supplementary Evaluation Results

The **QPET_Appendix.pdf** contains a complete appendix of QPET experimental results.
