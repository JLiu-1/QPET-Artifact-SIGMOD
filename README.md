# QPET integration for SZ3/QoZ/HPEZ (pointwise and regional QoI)

## Introduction

This branch includes the codes for SZ3-QPET, QoZ-QPET, and HPEZ-QPET on pointwise and regional QoIs (single-snapshot compression).

For vector QoI preservation on cross-snapshots compression, check the codes at: [link] 

## Dependencies

Please Install the following dependencies before compiling HPEZ:

* cmake>=3.13
* gcc>=6.0
* SymEngine (https://github.com/symengine/symengine)
* GMP (https://gmplib.org/) (The dependency of SymEngine)

## 3rd party libraries/tools

* Zstd >= 1.3.5 (https://facebook.github.io/zstd/). Not mandatory to be manually installed as Zstandard v1.4.5 is included and will be used if libzstd can not be found by pkg-config.

## Installation

* mkdir build && cd build
* cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[INSTALL_DIR] ..
* make
* make install

Then, you'll find all the executables in [INSTALL_DIR]/bin and header files in [INSTALL_DIR]/include. A Cmake version >= 3.13.0 is needed. 
Before you proceed to the following evaluations, you may add the installation path of HPEZ to your system path so that you can directly run hpez command in your machine for further evaluations.

## Single compression/decompression testing Examples

You can use the executable 'hpez' command to do the compression/decompression (the input data should be float or double binary files). Just run "hpez" command without any argument to check the instructions for its arguments.
For the convenience of tests, the qoz executable includes the SZ3.1 compression, QoZ 1.1 compression, and 3 optimization levels of HPEZ (QoZ 2.0) compression. In the command:
* -q 0: SZ3.1 compression.
* Containing -q 1: QoZ 1.1 compression.
* Containing -q 2 or -q 3: 2 intermediate optimization levels of HPEZ compression (having faster speeds but slightly worse rate-distortion).
* Not containing -q argument or containing -q 4: Full HPEZ (QoZ 2.0) compression (for the results reported in the paper).

Notice: the integrated SZ3.1 and QoZ 1.1 in HPEZ (QoZ 2.0) have already leveraged the Fast-varying-first interpolation (proposed in our paper), therefore their compression ratios are sometimes higher than the original public released versions of SZ3.1 and QoZ 1.1.
